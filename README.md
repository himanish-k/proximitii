## What is Proximitii?

It is meant to be a tool that measures the suitability of a real estate location based on your needs. As an example, let's say that there's a student who wants to know whether a particular apartment complex is suitable for his needs, this tool will show what the routes to the university are via various forms of transport, whether there are any gyms nearby, any restaurants that are open till late, any banks with ATMs, any saloons, etc.

This tool will display this information via a web interface partly through simple text display of information, but also partly through a map interface that visually displays this information and makes it easy to visualize the suitability of place for the person.

Of course, for the map interface, it only makes sense to use the Google Maps API. Other architecture, implementation details need to be made as well.
